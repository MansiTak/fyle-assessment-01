## Description

Design a website that displays the public Github repositories belonging to any specific user.

### Dependencies

Any browser, preferrable Google Chrome, Firefox or Edge.

### Notes

* Assumptions:
  1. The user enters a valid GitHub username.
  2. The user selects a valid number of repositories per page (10, 25, 50, or 100).
  3. The user has public repositories.

* Edge cases:
1. If the user enters an invalid username or doesn't exist, the website displays "No repositories found."
2. If the API calls fail, the website displays "Error fetching repositories. Please try again."
3. If the user has more than 100 repositories, the website displays the first 100 repositories.
4. If the user has no repositories, the website displays "No repositories found."
